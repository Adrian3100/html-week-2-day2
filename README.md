# week-2-day2 - Your very first Article Page

This README will guide you through creating an HTML page and managing it using GitHub. We will cover basic HTML elements and how to save and share your work.

## HTML Elements Used
In this HTML document, we use the following elements:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Tells the browser this is an HTML5 document.
- `<html>`: The main container for all content.
- `<head>`: Stores important information like the page title.
- `<meta>`: Helps with page settings (like character encoding).
- `<title>`: Defines the title that appears in the browser tab.
- `<body>`: Holds everything visible on the page.
- `<header>`: Displays the main heading at the top.
- `<h1>`: The largest heading, used for the main title.
- `<h2>`: A smaller heading for subtopics.
- `<p>`: A paragraph of text.
- `<strong>`: Makes text bold to show importance.
- `<em>`: Italicizes text for emphasis.
- `<div>`: A container that groups elements together.
- `<img>`: Displays an image on the page.
- `<ul>`: Creates a list with bullet points.
- `<li>`: Each item in a list.
- `<a>`: A clickable link to another page or website.
- `<article>`: Groups content into an article.
- `<footer>`: Adds a section at the bottom for extra information.

## How to Fork a GitHub Repository
If you want to save and share your HTML file using GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Visit the GitHub repository where the HTML file is stored.
2. Click the **Fork** button at the top-right corner. This makes a copy in your own GitHub account.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Download your copy to your computer using:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
5. Move into the folder with:
   ```sh
   cd repository-name
   ```
6. Open the repo in a text editor and make your changes.
7. Save your file.

## Steps to Create Your HTML Page
Follow these steps to build your web page:

1. Open a text editor like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text.
2. Create a new file and save it as `index.html`.
3. Type the basic structure of an HTML document:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>My Web Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
4. Inside `<body>`, add a `<header>` with an `<h1>` title.
5. Use the `<article>` tag to organize your content.
6. Inside `<article>`, add:
   - Headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) for structure.
   - Paragraphs (`<p>`) for text.
   - Emphasis tags (`<strong>`, `<em>`) to highlight words.
   - An image using `<img>`.
   - A bullet-point list with `<ul>` and `<li>`.
   - A hyperlink with `<a>`.
7. Add a `<footer>` at the bottom with your name or additional info.
8. Save the file and use Live Server, or Live Preview "Go Live" to see your work.
9. Now push to github to share your work.


Now you have your own HTML webpage, and it's saved on GitHub for easy sharing!
